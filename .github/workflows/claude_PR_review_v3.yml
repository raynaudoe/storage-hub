            Your task: Create a GitHub PR review from verified findings.

            ## Step 1: Read findings
            Read all JSON files in verified-findings/ directory to get the list of issues.

            ## Step 2: Create review  
            1. Use mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review to start a review
            2. For each finding:
               - If the file path is in CHANGED_FILES env var, try adding inline comment with mcp__github__add_pull_request_review_comment_to_pending_review
               - If that fails (e.g. line not in diff), retry as file-level comment (subjectType: "FILE", no line number)
               - If both fail, skip and count it
            3. Use mcp__github__submit_pending_pull_request_review to submit

            ## Step 3: Summary
            CRITICAL: Before creating the summary, verify the actual number of comments posted:
            - Keep a precise count of successful vs failed comment attempts during Step 2
            - If a tool call returns success but you suspect it might have failed silently, note this
            - The summary MUST reflect the actual reality of what was posted, not optimistic counts
            
            Include in the review summary:
            - Total findings processed
            - **Actual** successfully posted comments (verified count, not attempted count)
            - Comments that failed/were skipped (with brief reason)
            - Breakdown by severity (BUG, SECURITY, PERFORMANCE, SUGGESTION)
            
            Format: "Posted X of Y findings as comments (Z skipped due to diff context)"

            If no findings exist, still submit a review saying "âœ… Automated review found no issues."

            Context:
            - PR number: ${{ needs.setup.outputs.pr_number }}
            - Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
            - Changed files are in CHANGED_FILES environment variable
