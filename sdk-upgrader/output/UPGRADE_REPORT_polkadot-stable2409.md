# SDK Upgrade Report - polkadot-stable2409

## Global heuristics

*Patterns discovered during the upgrade that other agents should be aware of:*

â€¢ **XCM Dry Run API Change**: The `dry_run_call` function now requires an additional `result_xcms_version: u32` parameter. Update signatures and calls accordingly.
â€¢ **jsonrpsee Feature Changes**: Need to add `jsonrpsee-proc-macros` and `tracing` features to workspace dependencies to access proc macros.
â€¢ **jsonrpsee RPC Module Fixes**: Remove extra `.into()` calls in RPC module merges and adjust return types from `Ok(io.into())` to `Ok(io)` for compatibility.
â€¢ **Most procedural macro crates compile without changes**: sp-api-proc-macro, sp-runtime-interface-proc-macro, cumulus-pallet-parachain-system-proc-macro, etc. work out of the box.

### Overview
Most core polkadot SDK crates upgraded successfully from stable2407 to stable2409 with minimal workspace dependency updates.

### Common issues & fixes
â€¢ ðŸ”´ *XCM API breakage: `dry_run_call` expects 3 parameters*
  ðŸŸ¢ *API signature changed to include XCM version parameter*  
  âœ… *Added `result_xcms_version: u32` parameter to trait impls and calls*

â€¢ ðŸ”´ *jsonrpsee proc_macros not found*

### Optimisations & tips
â€¢ Active pallets (pallet-aura, pallet-balances, pallet-message-queue) already configured and build cleanly in runtime context
â€¢ Unused pallets (authority-discovery, collective, conviction-voting, democracy, identity, mmr, nis, ranked-collective, referenda, society, state-trie-migration) compile individually but not integrated in runtime
â€¢ Use versioned cargo check for ambiguous packages: pallet-balances@39.0.1, pallet-message-queue@41.0.2, pallet-authority-discovery@38.0.0
â€¢ All pallet crates configured with polkadot-stable2409 branch - workspace builds successfully with only dead code warnings

## pallet-asset-conversion, pallet-asset-tx-payment, pallet-assets, pallet-bounties, pallet-child-bounties, pallet-collator-selection, pallet-nfts, pallet-tips, pallet-transaction-payment-rpc-runtime-api, pallet-transaction-payment-rpc, pallet-treasury

### Overview
Substrate pallet crates successfully upgraded to polkadot-stable2409 by adding missing workspace dependencies for completeness - all crates already configured and building without code changes.

### Common issues & fixes
â€¢ ðŸ”´ *Missing workspace dependencies for pallet-asset-conversion, pallet-asset-tx-payment, pallet-assets, pallet-bounties, pallet-child-bounties, pallet-tips, pallet-treasury*
  ðŸŸ¢ *Pallets not explicitly declared in workspace but needed for individual crate checks*
  âœ… *Added pallet-asset-conversion, pallet-asset-tx-payment, pallet-assets, pallet-bounties, pallet-child-bounties, pallet-tips, pallet-treasury to workspace Cargo.toml*

â€¢ ðŸ”´ *Multiple crate version ambiguity when using `-p <crate>` flag for pallet-treasury*
  ðŸŸ¢ *Workspace contains both old and new versions from different SDK releases*
  âœ… *Use exact version specification: `cargo check -p pallet-treasury@37.0.0`*

â€¢ ðŸ”´ *Workspace builds with minor warning about unused field*
  ðŸŸ¢ *Unused `deny_unsafe` field in RPC FullDeps struct*
  âœ… *Warning does not prevent compilation; workspace builds successfully*

### Optimisations & tips
â€¢ Most assigned pallets (pallet-nfts, pallet-transaction-payment-rpc, pallet-transaction-payment-rpc-runtime-api, pallet-collator-selection) already in workspace dependencies
â€¢ New pallets (pallet-asset-conversion, pallet-asset-tx-payment, pallet-assets, pallet-bounties, pallet-child-bounties, pallet-tips, pallet-treasury) build cleanly without code changes
â€¢ Use versioned cargo check for ambiguous packages: pallet-treasury@37.0.0 to avoid conflicts
â€¢ All pallet crates already configured with polkadot-stable2409 branch - workspace builds successfully with only dead code warnings

## polkadot-core-primitives, polkadot-parachain-primitives, polkadot-primitives

### Overview
Core polkadot primitive crates already configured for polkadot-stable2409 in workspace dependencies and building successfully without any modifications needed.

### Common issues & fixes
â€¢ ðŸ”´ *Multiple crate version ambiguity when using `-p <crate>` flag*
  ðŸŸ¢ *Workspace contains both old and new versions from different SDK releases*
  âœ… *Use exact version specification: polkadot-core-primitives@15.0.0, polkadot-parachain-primitives@14.0.0, polkadot-primitives@16.0.0*

â€¢ ðŸ”´ *Workspace builds with minor warning about unused field*
  ðŸŸ¢ *Unused `deny_unsafe` field in RPC FullDeps struct leftover from jsonrpsee upgrade*
  âœ… *Warning does not prevent compilation; workspace builds successfully*

### Optimisations & tips
â€¢ All three polkadot primitive crates already configured in workspace with polkadot-stable2409 branch - no Cargo.toml changes needed
â€¢ Core primitives (polkadot-core-primitives@15.0.0, polkadot-parachain-primitives@14.0.0, polkadot-primitives@16.0.0) build cleanly with --all-targets
â€¢ Individual crate checks verify successfully in under 2 seconds each
â€¢ Workspace builds successfully with only one minor dead code warning
