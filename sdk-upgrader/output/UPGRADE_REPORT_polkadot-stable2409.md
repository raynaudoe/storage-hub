# SDK Upgrade Report - polkadot-stable2409

## Global heuristics

*Patterns discovered during the upgrade that other agents should be aware of:*

â€¢ **XCM Dry Run API Change**: The `dry_run_call` function now requires an additional `result_xcms_version: u32` parameter. Update signatures and calls accordingly.
â€¢ **jsonrpsee Feature Changes**: Need to add `jsonrpsee-proc-macros` and `tracing` features to workspace dependencies to access proc macros.
â€¢ **jsonrpsee RPC Module Fixes**: Remove extra `.into()` calls in RPC module merges and adjust return types from `Ok(io.into())` to `Ok(io)` for compatibility.
â€¢ **Most procedural macro crates compile without changes**: sp-api-proc-macro, sp-runtime-interface-proc-macro, cumulus-pallet-parachain-system-proc-macro, etc. work out of the box.
â€¢ **XCM Crates Test Dependencies**: XCM staging crates (staging-xcm, staging-xcm-executor, staging-xcm-builder) may fail test compilation due to missing `hex_literal` dev-dependency, but libs compile cleanly.
â€¢ **Cumulus Primitives**: All cumulus-primitives-* crates compile cleanly without code changes - just need workspace dependency declarations.
â€¢ **Cumulus Pallets**: All cumulus-pallet-* crates (parachain-system, aura-ext, session-benchmarking, xcm, xcmp-queue) are already configured and compile without issues in stable2409.

â€¢ Unused pallets (authority-discovery, collective, conviction-voting, democracy, identity, mmr, nis, ranked-collective, referenda, society, state-trie-migration) compile individually but not integrated in runtime
â€¢ Use versioned cargo check for ambiguous packages: pallet-balances@39.0.1, pallet-message-queue@41.0.2, pallet-authority-discovery@38.0.0
â€¢ All pallet crates configured with polkadot-stable2409 branch - workspace builds successfully with only dead code warnings
